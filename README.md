# Trivia Game Project for CPSC 8710

This is a simple trivia game that can be played through a video / voice call with up to four people. You can enter in names of players at the start of the game, as well as choose
a category to play in. One player controls the game and is able to select a button to indicate which player answered the question. At the end of the game, a winner is shown!

## Getting started

Install the packages (`npm install`, `yarn add`, or `bun install`, depending on your preferred package manager).
Then run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the Next.js framework to create a simple React app. TypeScript is also leveraged here!
The trivia questions are sourced from [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/), a sizable community database.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Vercel (who are also the creators of Next.js). In order to deploy, I linked it to the GitHub repository and set a commit to deploy from.
This app is hosted [here](https://trivia-game-project-three.vercel.app/).
