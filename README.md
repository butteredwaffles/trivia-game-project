# Trivia Game Project for CPSC 8710

Welcome to the Trivia Game Project, a fun and interactive game that can be played with up to four players. This game is designed to be played over video or voice calls, making it a great choice for virtual gatherings. In this game, players can enter their names at the start and choose a category to play in. One player takes control of the game and can select a button to indicate which player answered the question. At the end of the game, a winner is determined and displayed.

## Game Objective and Rules

The objective of the game is to answer trivia questions and earn points. Here are the basic rules:

- Players can enter their names and choose a category at the start of the game.
- One player takes control of the game and can start rounds.
- The controller can share their screen or read out questions to other players.
- Players should answer questions as quickly as possible to earn more points.
- The first correct answer earns 500 points, the second correct answer earns 400 points, and so on.
- A timer is set for one minute for each round, allowing all players to answer within the time limit.
- At the end of the game, a leaderboard displays the winner based on points earned.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js: Next.js is the framework used to create a simple React app for this project.
- TypeScript: TypeScript is leveraged to ensure type safety and maintainable code.
- Trivia Questions: The trivia questions used in the game are sourced from [OpenTDB](https://opentdb.com/), a community database with a wide range of questions.

## Setup

To get started with the Trivia Game, follow these steps:

Install the packages (`npm install`, `yarn add`, or `bun install`, depending on your preferred package manager).
Then run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Vercel (who are also the creators of Next.js). In order to deploy, I linked it to the GitHub repository and set a commit to deploy from.
This app is hosted and you can play it [here](https://trivia-game-project-three.vercel.app/).

## Reflection

The development of the Trivia Game was a valuable learning experience for our team. We faced several challenges, such as designing the game interface, choosing the right game mechanics, and integrating trivia questions. While some initial ideas did not work as expected, we were able to find solutions and create an enjoyable game.

One of the significant challenges was finding a reliable source of trivia questions with a wide variety of categories and difficulty levels. OpenTDB provided us with the flexibility we needed. Another challenge was the game's design and styling, as there were no dedicated front-end developers on the team. However, with the help of Next.js and TypeScript, we created a user-friendly interface.

We also had to make decisions about game mechanics, including the timer and point system. We wanted to encourage fast answers, and the point system we implemented rewarded quick thinking.

In the end, the Trivia Game Project was a successful and enjoyable project. We learned a lot about game development, front-end technologies, and teamwork. It was a great opportunity to apply our skills and create something new for all to enjoy.
